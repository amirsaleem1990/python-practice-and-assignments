9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166)
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0 Create an
instance called restaurant from this class Print the number of customers
the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again
    Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
of customers that have been served Call this method with a new number and
print the value again
    Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served Call this method with any
number you like that could represent how many customers were served in,
say, a day of business
